## Business Problem

The City Hotel and Resort Hotel are experiencing high rates of booking cancellations which have impacted their revenue and occupancy rates. This project aims to analyze patterns in these cancellations, identify the main drivers, and provide actionable recommendations to reduce future cancellations.

## Datasets

The data spans from 2015 to 2017 and includes information such as booking ID, hotel type (City or Resort), cancellation status, booking date, arrival date, lead time, country of origin, market segment, distribution channel, daily rate, and other relevant booking details.

## Research Questions

1. What factors are significantly associated with higher cancellation rates?
2. How do cancellation rates vary by time (e.g., season, month) and by hotel type?
3. What strategies can be implemented to mitigate the impact of high cancellation rates on revenue?

## Analysis Techniques

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Utilize statistical summaries and visualization tools to understand the distribution and relationships of the data.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Apply logistic regression to predict the likelihood of cancellation based on various features.
- **Time Series Analysis:** Evaluate trends and seasonality effects on booking cancellations.

## Findings

- **Price Sensitivity:** Guests are more likely to cancel when the prices are perceived as too high.
- **Booking Lead Time:** Longer lead times are associated with an increased likelihood of cancellations.
- **Seasonal Variations:** Cancellation rates are higher in January and August due to various factors including weather and holiday periods.

## Recommendations

- **Dynamic Pricing Strategy:** Adjust prices based on demand and booking characteristics to decrease cancellations.
- **Improved Booking Terms:** Shorten the maximum lead time and implement non-refundable deposits to secure revenues.
- **Targeted Marketing Campaigns:** Increase promotional efforts during low-demand periods to boost occupancy rates.
